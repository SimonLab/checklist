# checklist
A checklist for using Github as a project management tool. In the context of a project management tool Github issues are called user stories.

## Create user story

* [ ] Create issue for each user story
* [ ] Add a time estimation label for each user. Estimation time = documentation + development + tests 
* [ ] Add a milestone to the user story to define which sprint the user story belongs to
* [ ] Add a label to prioritize the user story
* [ ] Add other labels to precise the nature of the user story (technical, bug, enhancement,...)


## Work on the user story

* [ ] Assigne someone or yourself when the work on the user story starts
* [ ] Add the label "in progress" to inform your team you are currently working on the user story and to keep time spend on the task
* [ ] Update the Readme before working on a user story: **what, why, how**
* [ ] Add comments to the user story to descibe the progress of your work. Your team will know if you have some problem and can help you. Your clients can also see what you are working on and it can help them to understand your work
* [ ] If you haven't finished a user story at the end of a day, take 1/2h to add a clear and precise description of the current status of the user story. People can easily replace you if you can't finish the user story
* [ ] Each commmtis must refere a user story

## Complete the user story is completed

* [ ] Are all tests passing?
* [ ] Is the coverage still 100%?
* [ ] Create a pull request
* [ ] Assign someone to review your pull request
* [ ] Delete the label "in progress"
* [ ] Update the time estimation label if you have to
* [ ] Close the issue
* [ ] Write a blog or a tutorial to consolidate your learning during a user story and to share your tricks!
